        <p>Considering studying languages, literature, history, philosophy, or cultural studies in college? You might be passionate about reading, writing, ideas, and persuasion, or interested in pursuing a career in academia, law, media, or creative writing.

            of higher education in any field.</p>
        <p>Studying the humanities can be a rewarding, though often challenging, path. There are many pre-collegiate summer programs in the STEM disciplines, but the average applicant to a humanities degree is unlikely to have much knowledge or experience in the field they intend to major in beyond what they learn at school.</p>
        <p><strong>Humanities Class</strong> is a 10-week virtual summer program for rising high school sophomores, juniors, and seniors who want to enrich their profile for college admissions by doing research in the humanities in high school. Participants will gain familiarity with their areas of interest and become more nuanced readers and writers by completing an individualized and in-depth college-level research project in their field of choice.</p>
        <p>With the right guidance, materials, and mentorship, completing a research project before college can help you stand out from the crowd. As the most selective colleges increasingly look at extracurricular activities as a deciding factor in admissions decisions, it's important to showcase your interests and passions, but also reveal depth of commitment and initiative in your area of interest. College admissions counselors will like to see college-level research experience in applicants. The critical thinking and writing skills you gain from this program will make your application stand out from the rest.</p>
        <p>It is normal to be unsure about what you want to study in college when you don't know what it is really like to take classes in your field of interest. Through meaningful exposure in the field you are considering, you can determine early on if it is right for you.</p>

                    <p>B.A. in Comparative Literature, German, and College Scholar from Cornell University</p>
                    <p>John chose to major in comparative literature because of the wide range of big questions it asks, like what narratives are, how we should read poetry, what literature can do, and what the implications of these questions are for how we understand history, ideas, and politics. In the College Scholar Program, he designed his own course of study and wrote a thesis that draws from various disciplines of the humanities. His thesis tracks the history of the concept of the self from the Protestant Reformation to surveillance capitalism and argues why the western obsession with privacy and civil liberties provides an insufficient ground to counter surveillance. After graduating, he is taking some time off from school to pursue journalism.</p>

                    <p>People and their stories are at the heart of Eliana's research, which focuses primarily on questions of autobiography, child development, memory and trauma. She works mainly with 18th-20th century English, French, and German literature, and has also written extensively on problems of witnessing in the wake of the Holocaust. Her senior thesis, "'The Riddle of Life': Child's Play, Or the Play of Interpretation in Literature and Psychoanalysis," pursued an interdisciplinary reading of texts by Freud and Goethe, a project that began in her fascination with the story of Freud's grandson's childhood play. She looks forward to sharing her passion for literary and psychoanalytic theory with high school students this summer!</p>

                    <p >Working in a number of Asian and European languages and specializing in the 20th and 21st centuries, Elvin is interested in what happens when people and ideas move across cultural and linguistic boundaries. Using a wide variety of sources such as language textbooks, philosophical treatises, and anime, his research reveals how marginal communities create authentic meanings through strategies of translation, appropriation, and repression. His work also explores the intersections between the humanities and the STEM disciplines. Elvin's most recent project, "Viral Text: Translation, Censorship, Community," examines social media practices in China and the West during the 2020 pandemic to revise age-old understandings of authorship, language, and truth.</p>

                    <p>As an undergraduate, Taylor worked predominantly at the intersection of art history, visual culture, intellectual history, and literature, ranging from Berlin Dada and Pittura Metafisica to what some now refer to as the neo-avant-garde. An encounter with the writings of historian Aby Warburg inspired her to transition in focus from the twentieth century to Renaissance Studies. Her undergraduate thesis, "H(&), H(and)," explored ancient and early modern representations and discussions — visual, rhetorical, and philosophical — of "hands" to better understand contemporaneous metaphysics. She is interested in how images' perceived meanings change (or, even more importantly, do not change) over time, from Greco-Roman antiquity to the present day, and what such tracings might tell us about historical categories.</p>

                    <p>Originating from their musical and academic experiences alike, John's research predominantly deals with intersections of music, philosophy, and literature in Europe during the long nineteenth century. Their essay, "Poetics of History, Logics of Collapse: On Heidegger's Hölderlin," is forthcoming in <em>The German Quarterly</em>. Further research topics include: narrative ontology in Naturalist and Decadent fiction; Borges's use of transfinite numbers; hermeneutics of the German song cycle; early twentieth century Chinese literature and linguistics; Japan's media mix; concert audience performativity; and the experimental text-setting of avant-garde composer Luigi Nono. After graduation, they matriculated to the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. John ultimately hopes to complete a Ph.D. and work toward increasing accessibility of education in the spheres of both music and academia.</p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The program is guided by graduates with humanities degrees and approximates the experience of undergraduates in a humanities seminar at a prestigious university in the U.S.</p>
            <p>This means that students will learn to think about texts not in isolation but in connection to big ideas that cross disciplinary boundaries. The class enables intellectual exploration and freedom from any set canon but also gives a birds-eye view of the major methods and schools of thought with which one implicitly comes into dialogue in any humanistic inquiry.</p>
            <p>Before applying to college, students who enroll will:</p>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li>produce a sophisticated research paper they can add to their writing portfolio,</li>
                <li>deepen their knowledge in humanistic research methods, schools of thought, key figures, and driving questions,</li>
                <li>specify and refine the areas they want to pursue further, and</li>
                <li>enhance their critical thinking, writing, and reading skills and knowledge in the humanities beyond what high schools usually cover.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the student completes the project in a satisfactory manner, our instructors are happy to provide them with a letter of recommendation.</p>
            <p>At the end of the program, we can also assist students with applying for research competitions and getting their research published in student journals.</p>
